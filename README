This is a small Django application that stores Call Detail Record (CDR) logs from Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone systems.

Note that my need for this application was my reason to begin learning Django. This is early code for a first Django project, so it should not necessarily be taken as production quality code.

Any feedback on this is encouraged in the form of Issues on github.

Instructions:

Modify settings.py

Create values for PROJECT_DIRECTORY and LOG_FILE_NAME
Create a value for SECRET_KEY
