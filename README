This is a small Django application that stores Call Detail Record (CDR) logs from Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone systems. The data may be retrieved and viewed by date range.

It has been tested with the following PBX systems:

Inter-Tel Axxess 8520

Any feedback is appreciated! Please feel free to fork, report issues, and make pull requests on github.

Instructions:

You will need a means to retrieve SMDR data from your PBX. This is most commmonly done by a serial connection or TCP/IP.

The utilities directory contains a simple client for gathering SMDR data from the Inter-Tel Axxess 8520 by TCP/IP and adding it to an sqlite database.

Once you have SMDR flowing to your database, you must customize settings.py for your configuration. In particular, you must

- Create values for PROJECT_DIRECTORY and LOG_FILE_NAME
- Create a value for SECRET_KEY (and keep it secret)

Then set it up and serve it like any other Django project
